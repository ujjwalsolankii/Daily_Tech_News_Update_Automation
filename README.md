# 📬 Daily Tech Digest Automation (Make.com + Gemini + Gmail)

## 🚀 Overview
This project automates the process of generating and sending daily tech news updates using **Google Gemini AI** and **Make.com (formerly Integromat)**.  
It connects Gemini for content generation and Gmail for automated delivery — creating a hands-free, personalized tech newsletter.

---

## 🧠 What It Does
Every day (or on-demand), this automation:
1. **Generates curated tech news** from Gemini AI based on the latest global trends.  
2. **Cleans and formats the response** into a human-like summary (no Markdown clutter or AI tone).  
3. **Sends the digest to your email inbox** using the Gmail module on Make.com.

The output reads like a professional newsletter — short, informative, and naturally written.
